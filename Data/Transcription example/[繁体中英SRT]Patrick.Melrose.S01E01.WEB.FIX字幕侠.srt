1
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:30,940
喂
Hello.

2
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:34,794
你好
Hello?

3
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:40,451
帕特裏克 喂 是你嗎
Patrick. Hello, Patrick, is that you?

4
00:00:40,685 --> 00:00:41,725
尼古拉斯
Nicholas?

5
00:00:43,028 --> 00:00:46,022
帕特裏克 不瞞你說我有個壞消息
Patrick, I'm afraid I have rather bad news.

6
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:47,817
你在聽嗎
Hello?

7
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,177
喂 帕特裏克 能聽到嗎
Hello, Patrick, can you hear me

8
00:00:50,177 --> 00:00:51,611
我在紐約
I'm in New York.

9
00:00:53,017 --> 00:00:54,502
聲音好像有點延遲
There appears to be a delay.

10
00:00:55,462 --> 00:00:57,062
-你能聽到嗎  -能
- Can you hear me? - Yes.

11
00:00:58,348 --> 00:01:01,480
-是關於你父親的  -我能聽到
- It concerns your father. - I can hear you.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,731
我在呢
I'm here.

13
00:01:03,428 --> 00:01:06,594
你父親前晚去世了 在酒店房間裏
Your father died the night before last, in his hotel room.

14
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:15,565
這打擊來得太突然了
It must come as an awful shock to you.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,897
可能吧 嗯
Something like that, yes.

16
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,468
不用說你也知道我的感覺
I hardly need to tell you how I feel.

17
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:27,045
我很崇敬你父親 大家都喜歡他
I adored your father. Everybody liked him.

18
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,771
雖然他有時不好相處
I know he wasn't always the easiest of men.

19
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,931
你在聽嗎 帕特裏克
Are you there, Patrick?

20
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,068
我在 他現在在哪兒
Yes, I'm here. Where is he now?

21
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,765
大衛嗎
David?

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,188
他在弗蘭克·E·麥克唐納那兒 麥迪遜的殯儀館
He's at Frank E. Macdonalds, the funeral people on Madison.

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,411
大家都去那兒
Everyone goes there.

24
00:01:46,822 --> 00:01:50,089
"寧缺毋濫" 你父親肯定會這麼說
"Only the best or go without," as your father would have said.

25
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:54,400
如果你想見他 帶回骨灰...
If you want to see him and collect the ashes...

26
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:59,800
-你嗑藥了嗎  -不 現在沒
- Do you have much on? - Not at this exact moment, no.

27
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:02,360
那我們得見一面
Then we must meet up.

28
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,085
就在鑰匙俱樂部見吧 喬治·沃特福德也在
Why don't we meet at the Key Club? George Watford's here.

29
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:08,571
為你父親非凡的一生舉杯
We'll raise a glass to your father's extraordinary life.

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:10,937
還有
Well, until then,

31
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,388
我很遺憾告訴你這麼難過的消息
I'm sorry to be the bearer of such sad tidings.

32
00:02:14,388 --> 00:02:18,457
嗯 真是... 沉重的打擊
Yes, it's...a great blow.

33
00:02:18,457 --> 00:02:19,457
再見
Goodbye.

34
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:36,651
老混蛋終於死了
Old bastard's only gone and died.

35
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,280
他怎麼死的
How did he die?

36
00:03:55,342 --> 00:03:57,840
忘記問了 我都高興死了
I forgot to ask, I was too dizzy with glee.

37
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
不好意思 我是說難過瘋了
I'm sorry, I mean, dazed with grief.

38
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,348
能不能... 別弄我頭髮
I wonder... could you please stop fiddling with my hair?

39
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:09,085
我得喝點酒 好好喝一杯
I need a drink, a serious drink.

40
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:12,571
我們慶祝一下
Let's celebrate.

41
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,908
我們可以出去喝一杯
We could go out for a glass of wine.

42
00:04:15,908 --> 00:04:17,942
或者... 你大概不感興趣
Or... you're probably not interested,

43
00:04:17,942 --> 00:04:18,971
但我們被邀請
but we have been invited

44
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,862
跟格利高裏和麗貝卡共進晚餐
to Gregory and Rebecca's for dinner.

45
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:22,988
"痛苦是在別人吃飯時產生的"
"Suffering's what takes place while other people are eating."

46
00:04:22,988 --> 00:04:23,908
這是誰說的
Who said that?

47
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,514
抱歉 我現在有點混亂
I'm sorry. I'm feeling a bit mad at the moment.

48
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,874
這是段複雜的關係
It was a complicated relationship.

49
00:04:28,874 --> 00:04:29,897
有很多事要考慮
There's a lot to think about.

50
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:31,708
是 我覺得海洛因也幫不上什麼忙
Yes, I'm not sure the heroin's helping either.

51
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,434
你覺得這樣好嗎
Do you think that was a good idea?

52
00:04:33,434 --> 00:04:34,662
當然不好
Of course it wasn't a good idea!

53
00:04:34,662 --> 00:04:36,428
我只想說
I merely meant that perhaps

54
00:04:36,794 --> 00:04:39,577
這或許是你改變的好時機
this might be a good time to make a change.

55
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:41,028
重新開始
Start afresh!

56
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:43,840
在你讓我及時行樂前 我最好先走
I'd better leave before you tell me to seize the fucking day.

57
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,868
他已經死了
Do you think, now he's dead,

58
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,154
你能別再那麼像他嗎
that you could be a little less like him?

59
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,497
不行 我得把他那份也發揮好
Unlikely. I'll merely have to do the work of two.

60
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:56,320
黛比 對不起 我不擅長陪伴別人
Debbie, I'm sorry, I'm not fit for human company.

61
00:04:58,485 --> 00:05:00,891
別走 留下來
Don't go. Stay.

62
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:03,765
-回床上來  -不行
- Come back to bed. - I can't.

63
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,754
話說 我聽人說過
You know, I heard it said somewhere

64
00:05:09,754 --> 00:05:13,371
其實悲傷能刺激性慾
that grief was meant to be an aphrodisiac.

65
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:17,131
你感覺是這樣嗎
Do you think that might be true?

66
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,800
哼 想得美
Ha! You wish.

67
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:23,251
你媽媽怎麼樣
How's your mother taking it?

68
00:05:23,828 --> 00:05:26,697
她在乍得的救助兒童會工作
She's working with Save The Children in Chad.

69
00:05:26,697 --> 00:05:28,405
消息還沒傳到她那兒
No-one can break the news.

70
00:05:28,405 --> 00:05:30,885
-永遠在為他人著想  -沒錯
- Always thinking of others. - Indeed.

71
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,240
-那是什麼  -鎮定劑
- What's that? - Valium.

72
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,628
這才像話
That's more like it.

73
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:40,308
對了 我想戒毒了
By the way, I think I'm going to give up drugs.

74
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,194
你覺得我做不到
You don't think I can.

75
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:44,131
-我有點懷疑  -我之前戒過
- I'm a little skeptical. - I've done it before.

76
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:47,320
對啊 這次有什麼區別嗎
Exactly! What's so different this time?

77
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,405
你根本不是會戒毒的那種人 你太愛它了
You're hardly the Rehab-type and besides, you like it too much.

78
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,531
除非跌落谷底 癮君子是不會戒毒的
Addicts don't give up until they hit rock bottom,

79
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:56,857
而你永遠不會
and you never will.

80
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,337
-你太講究了  -不 你錯了
- You're too upholstered. - Well, you're wrong.

81
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,588
我這次會成功的
I'm gonna get it right this time.

82
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,737
好吧 加油 帕特裏克
Well, good for you, Patrick!

83
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,354
至少要戒掉可卡因和海洛因
Cocaine and heroin at least.

84
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:06,937
想要會跑 得先會走
Don't want to run before I can walk.

85
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,211
說起來 你還有鎮定劑嗎
To which end, have you got any more Valium?

86
00:06:10,211 --> 00:06:12,960
-為了幫我戒毒  -抱歉 最後一支
- Help me wean myself off. - Sorry, last one.

87
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:20,240
我沒別的意思 但你是不是要暴富了
Please don't take this the wrong way, does this mean you're now fantastically rich?

88
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,074
不 我媽媽才是繼承人
No, my mummy's the one with all the money,

89
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,931
而且她非常健康
and she's very healthy.

90
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,114
"太陽升起 一切如常" [語出塞繆爾·貝克特 "墨菲"]
"And the sun shone, having no alternative."

91
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:36,800
好 該及時行樂了
Well, it's time to seize the fucking day!

92
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,828
再見
Goodbye.

93
00:06:43,497 --> 00:06:45,548
你也再見
And goodbye.

94
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,771
再見了 海洛因 我的老朋友
And goodbye, heroin, my old friend.

95
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:51,205
大家把戒毒想得太複雜了
People make far too big a deal about getting clean.

96
00:06:53,468 --> 00:06:58,165
不過話說回來... 坐飛機會很緊張的
On the other hand... air travel can be very stressful.

97
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,240
那祝你好運
Well, good luck.

98
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,594
別在大街上出醜
Don't score off the streets.

99
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,765
我根本就不會出醜
I'm not going to score off anywhere.

100
00:07:46,765 --> 00:07:50,114
說真的 強尼 你得隨心所欲
Seriously, Johnny. You must do whatever you want,

101
00:07:50,114 --> 00:07:52,925
我要是想掌控自己的人生 得從現在開始
but if I'm to take control of my life, it has to be now.

102
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,205
這對於我
This is one of the most important things

103
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,760
是非常重要的事
to have happened to me

104
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,148
這次我一定要成功
and I want to get it absolutely right.

105
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:00,428
真羨慕你的決心
I wish I had your determination.

106
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,971
謝謝你送我
Thank you for the lift.

107
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
和其他時候一樣
As in so many other occasions,

108
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,600
沒有你 我做不到
I wouldn't have made it without you.

109
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,045
我的榮幸 兩天後再見 你就是全新的人
It's a pleasure. I'll see you back here in two days' time, a new man.

110
00:08:10,048 --> 00:08:11,548
脫胎換骨
An entirely new man.

111
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,188
來自倫敦希思羅機場的
Will all passengers recently arrived

112
00:08:22,714 --> 00:08:24,965
各位旅客
from London Heathrow,

113
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:28,131
請到行李領取處...
please make your way to the baggage claim...

114
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,377
"死了 那麼久
"Dead, long dead.

115
00:08:36,834 --> 00:08:39,657
那麼久 我的心已化為塵土"[語出丁尼生 "莫德"]
Long dead! And my heart is a handful of dust."

116
00:08:39,657 --> 00:08:42,337
還有... 別的... 什麼
And... something... something else.

117
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,325
我的天 振作一點
Oh, for Christ's sake, cheer up.

118
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,422
想點高興的
Think happy thoughts.

119
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:46,977
記住你為什麼來
Remember why you're here.

120
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:49,365
你是來給你爹收屍的
You're here to collect your father's corpse!

121
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,771
鎮定劑失效了 感覺有點焦躁
Valium's wearing off, feeling just a little twitchy now.

122
00:08:58,777 --> 00:09:01,794
鎮靜... 克制
Hold on. Just... hold on.

123
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:07,691
噁心 焦慮 皮膚裏像有蟲子爬
Queasy, nervous, maggots under the skin,

124
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,091
胃裏像有溺水的小貓
litter of drowning kittens in my stomach.

125
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,177
媽的
Fuck off!

126
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,788
你能換條路嗎
Can you take another route?

127
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:14,805

140
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,531

150
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,314
我知道 我以前用過電視
Yes, I have used a television before.

151
00:10:23,314 --> 00:10:26,977
恐懼 抽筋 自殺的念頭...
Paranoia, cramps, suicidal thoughts...

152
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:28,290
謝謝
Thank you.

153
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:36,902
至少 這是最後一次了
Still, at least it's the last time.

154
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:38,497
或是最後幾次中的一次
Or among the last times.

155
00:10:39,525 --> 00:10:42,091
這次不行 這次不一樣
Not this time. This time it's different.

156
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:45,428
不當囚犯 要像火焰噴射器一樣專注
No prisoners. Concentration like a flame-thrower.

157
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,062
新的一天 新的開始
New day, new beginning.

158
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,925
關鍵在於不想它
The trick is not to think about it.

159
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
怎麼可能不想它呢
How can you not think about it?

160
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:55,462
就像房間著火的時候
It's like not wanting to get out of a wheelchair

161
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:56,897
不想離開輪椅
when the room's on fire.

162
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:06,742
我的天
Oh, God.

163
00:11:12,342 --> 00:11:14,085
想要城裏最好的海洛因
For the best heroin in town,

164
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:17,337
打給皮埃爾 555-1726
simple call Pierre, 555-1726.

165
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:20,537
皮埃爾 555-1726
That's Pierre, 555-1726.

166
00:11:20,537 --> 00:11:22,280
不要想它
Don't think about it.

167
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,131

Patrick!

168

169
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:29,200
年輕人 你需要去公園散散步
What you need, young man, is a nice walk in the park.

170
00:11:33,822 --> 00:11:34,931

No smack, though!

171
00:11:34,931 --> 00:11:36,902
這我得說清楚
I want to make that absolutely clear!

172
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:38,720
不 管家 不要海洛因 我發誓
No, Nanny. No smack, I swear.

173

174
00:11:39,822 --> 00:11:43,000
嗯 我有 萊蒙741 五刀一個
Sure, I got Quaaludes. Lemmon 714s, five dollars each.

175
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,737
我不能指望立馬戒掉一切 對吧
I can hardly be expected to give up everything at once. Can I?

176
00:11:45,737 --> 00:11:49,222
來五個 不 六個 苯丙胺[興奮劑]有嗎
I'll take five, no, six. What about speed?

177
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:51,057
為啥要買苯丙胺 你瘋了嗎
Why the hell are you buying speed. Are you mad?

178
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:54,737
我有黑美人[興奮劑] 哥們 正經藥
Yo. I got some Black Beauties, man. They're pharmaceutical.

179
00:11:54,737 --> 00:11:55,880

Meaning you made them yourself?

180
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,525
-意思是藥很好  -不要買苯丙胺
- Meaning they're good. - Do not buy any speed.

來三個 衝動消費
Give me three. Impulse buy.

182
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:02,137
-你是英國人吧  -是
- Ooh, you're British, right? - That's right.

183
00:12:02,137 --> 00:12:03,514
穿著大衣不熱嗎
Ain't you hot in that coat?

184
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,725
聽說你們那兒海洛因免費
I hear they give you free heroin there?

185
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,977
-別騷擾他 -嗯 不完全
- Don't bother the man. - Well, not exactly free.

186
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:09,062
脫了大衣 哥們 你在出汗
Take your coat off, man, you sweating.

187
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,514

I got cocaine too, real good shit.

189
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,902
我說了別煩他
I said don't bother him.

190
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:15,720
我相信你 但我已經戒了
I don't doubt it, but I've given that up!

191
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,382
哥們 你得喝點水 哥們
Yo, man, you need some water, man.

192
00:12:19,045 --> 00:12:20,217
我可是專業的
I'm not an amateur.

193
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:23,571
明天再來啊
Yo, you come back here tomorrow!

194
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,222
有什麼能幫您嗎 先生
Can I help you, sir?

195
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:37,782
嗯 我是來告別遺體的
Yes, I've come to see the corpse.

196
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,885
抱歉 我能要杯水嗎 我...
Sorry, can I have a glass of water? I...

197
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:45,131
一大顆藥卡在我的...
I have a large pill stuck in my...

198
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
唾液不夠...
Not enough saliva...

199
00:13:02,834 --> 00:13:03,474
好了
Now.

200
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:06,765
我來領大衛·梅爾羅斯的遺體
I've come to see the corpse of David Melrose.

201
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,028
梅爾羅斯先生在走廊盡頭
You'll find Mr. Melrose at the end of the corridor.

202
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,331
帕特裏克 過來 快來
Patrick! Come here! Right now!

203
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,840
水星 金星 地球 火星...
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars...

204
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,750
木星 土星 天王星
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,

205
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:15,588
-馬提尼 先生  -啥 不用 謝謝
- Martini, sir. - What? No, thank you.

206
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,897
經典莫吉托呢
Mojito Old-fashioned?

207
00:14:24,674 --> 00:14:26,822
你怎麼認識赫爾曼的
Oh, how did you know Hermann?

208
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,285
真他媽難以置信
I can't fucking believe it!

209
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,822
注意言辭
Whoa, there!

210
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,400
屍體他媽不對
Wrong fucking corpse!

211
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:40,662
-你確定嗎  -死亡能改變一切
- Oh. Are you sure? - Death transforms us all,

212
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:43,651
但沒強大到把我父親變成猶太矮子
but it's not so powerful as to turn my father into a small Jew.

213
00:14:43,651 --> 00:14:45,217
再確認一下
Try again.

214
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:48,794
但樓裏沒有別的聚會啊
But we don't have another party in the building.

215
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:53,560
我不想參加聚會 我是來見大衛·梅爾羅斯的
I don't want to go to a party, I want to see David Melrose!

216
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:58,600
-應該在這兒  -謝謝
- This is the correct room. - Thank you.

217
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,085
-麻煩替我道個歉...  -不不不
- And please apologize to... - No, no, no.

218
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:02,805
您情緒激動是正常的
It's an emotional time.

219
00:15:02,805 --> 00:15:05,251
是 所以我吃了安眠酮
Yes, that's why I took a Quaalude

220
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,457
但好像沒用
but it must have been a dud.

221
00:15:06,457 --> 00:15:09,080
-我很遺憾  -我能之後再來取骨灰嗎
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. - Can I pick him up later?

222
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,080
可以的話 我想先離開紐約
I would like to get away from New York if at all possible.

223
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,142
您明天午後方可領走令尊的骨灰
Your father's ashes will be available tomorrow afternoon.

224
00:15:15,742 --> 00:15:18,697
這樣啊 快點不行嗎
I see. No chance of a rush job?

225
00:15:20,205 --> 00:15:22,942
我不打擾你們了
I'll leave you alone with him.

226
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:00,782
幹點正事
Get this right.

227
00:16:01,834 --> 00:16:02,834
這... 這是我爸嗎
Is it... Is it Dad?

228
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:10,565
還真是 就是我相見的
It is! It's just what I wanted!

229
00:16:10,565 --> 00:16:11,920
不該這麼說
You shouldn't have!

230
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:20,000
媽的 老爸 你在棺材裏幹嘛
Fucking hell, Dad. What are you doing in a coffin?

231
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:58,457
這兒怎麼了
What happened here?

232
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,525
你不想死 對吧
You didn't want to go, did you?

233
00:17:06,965 --> 00:17:09,880
你知道自己要死 沒錯
You knew you were going to die and you were right.

234
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:13,462
什麼感覺
What did that feel like?

235
00:17:16,691 --> 00:17:19,245
痛苦嗎 憤怒嗎
Pain or rage?

236
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,365
你害怕嗎
Were you scared?

237
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,022
天啊 希望如此
Christ, I hope so.

238
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:40,600
不 不對
No. No.

239
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:45,611
不會的 不可能
No, no, no!

240
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:54,982
操
Fuck.

241
00:17:59,005 --> 00:18:02,022
你真他媽好慘哦 老爸
Aw, you're so fucking sad, Dad, man,

242
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:04,497
你還想讓我難過
and now you're trying to make me sad too.

243
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,834
沒門
Well, bad luck.

244
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:27,034
嗨 帕特裏克
Hello, Patrick.

245
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:30,205
怎麼了
What's up?

246
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,360
你在發抖
You're shaking.

247
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,862
怎麼回事 帕特裏克
What is it, Patrick?

248
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:42,171
你媽媽呢 想跟她說說嗎
What about your mother? You want to tell your mother?

249
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:48,302
好 我馬上回來 我保證
Okay, I'll be right back. I promise.

250
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,680
看著很有意思
Well, that looks fun.

251
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,337
抗生素而已
Antibiotics.

252
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:04,057
-帕特裏克 我很遺憾  -我也是
- Patrick. I am so sorry. - I'm sorry too.

253
00:19:04,057 --> 00:19:06,160
準時是我從父親那遺傳的
Punctuality is one of the smaller vices

254
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,205
小缺陷之一
I've inherited from my father.

255
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:09,554
你知道我說的不是這個
I think you know that's not what I meant.

256
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:12,057
-麻煩來杯茶 伯爵紅茶  -好的
- Oh, tea, please, Earl Grey. - Uh-huh.

257
00:19:12,057 --> 00:19:13,971
-能再來一杯嗎  -可以
- And another of these? - Certainly.

258
00:19:13,973 --> 00:19:16,193
對我來說 現在是9點
For me, it's nine o'clock.

259
00:19:16,193 --> 00:19:18,686
對你 永遠都是9點
For you, it's always nine o'clock.

260
00:19:18,686 --> 00:19:20,680
管他呢... 麻煩也給我一杯馬提尼
Oh, what the hell... a martini for me too, please.

261
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:24,260
-你去過...  -太平間嗎
- So, have you been to... - The mortuary?

262
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,400
去過了 是我見過他最好的狀態了
Yes, yes, the best I've ever seen him.

263
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
我不想讓你幻想破滅
Well, I don't wanna disillusion you,

264
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,393
不過他們給你的骨灰
but when they give you the ashes,

265
00:19:30,393 --> 00:19:32,340
只是從爐底
they're really just the communal rakings

266
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,480
-隨便鏟的  -那很好啊
- from the bottom of the oven. - That's good news!

267
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,660
理論上 它們各有所屬
Ideally they'd all belong to someone else.

268
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,220
小時候 父親常帶我去飯店...
When I was young, he used to take us to restaurants...

269
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,886
很多飯店
I say restaurants in the plural,

270
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:45,840
因為我們每天進出至少三家
because we never stormed in and out of less than three.

271
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,353
我記得有一次 他倒提一瓶干紅
I remember one occasion he held a bottle of claret upside down

272
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:52,386
酒咕咚咕咚流到地毯上
as the contents gurgle out onto the carpet.

273
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:56,493
"你們怎敢給我這等污物"
"How dare you bring me this filth?"

274
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:59,260
現在他在那邊沒法抱怨了
Well, at least he's somewhere he can't complain about.

275
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,946
我還想著他從棺材裏坐起來
I half expected him to sit upright in the coffin

276
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:03,973
像日落時的吸血鬼
like a vampire at sunset.

277
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:07,560
"這也算棺材 這裏的服務簡直不能忍"
"Call this a coffin? The service here is intolerable!"

278
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,360
別說 他們的服務真的不行
Mind you, the service was intolerable.

279
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,993
給我指到別人那兒去了
They sent me to the wrong corpse.

280
00:20:13,993 --> 00:20:15,693
-別的屍體  -對
- The wrong corpse? - Yes.

281
00:20:15,693 --> 00:20:18,406
真諷刺 父親屍骨難尋
Ironic that my father's remains were so hard to find,

282
00:20:18,406 --> 00:20:20,926
我身上卻滿是他的影子
when I have no trouble discovering them in myself.

283
00:20:26,866 --> 00:20:28,246
很高興見到你 安妮
It's good to see you, Anne.

284
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,213
我真得見個熟人緩緩
I did need to see a friendly face.

285
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,513
確實...他是個複雜的人
Well...he was a complicated man.

286
00:20:35,513 --> 00:20:36,733
因此我今天才...
Which is why I was...

287
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:39,500
急切地想跟你談談
so keen to talk to you today.

288
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,480
-安眠酮總算起效了  -帕特裏克 你還好嗎
- Here come the Quaaludes. - Patrick, are you okay?

289
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,126
有一點... 時差
Jet-lag... kicking in.

290
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:48,300
-要躺一下嗎  -不用這麼誇張
- You wanna go lie down? - No, let's not exaggerate.

291
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,833
就稍微有點困
Just a little sleepy.

292
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,980
抗生素
The antibiotics.

293
00:20:56,693 --> 00:20:57,780
不好意思了
Excuse me.

294
00:21:33,693 --> 00:21:35,386
梅爾羅斯先生
Mr. Melrose!

295
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:36,506
您還好嗎
All good?

296
00:21:36,506 --> 00:21:39,233
時差很嚴重
Very jet-lagged.

297
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,493
操
Oh, fuck.

298
00:21:54,393 --> 00:21:55,320
這就行了
That'll fool 'em!

299
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:00,993
我的天
Oh, good God.

300
00:22:00,993 --> 00:22:03,986
-幹嘛去了你  -洗了把臉

301
00:22:03,986 --> 00:22:06,133

- What kind of water? - Very refreshing water.

302
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,806
帕特裏克 請你坐好 你讓我有點緊張
Patrick, please sit down, you're making me nervous.

303
00:22:08,806 --> 00:22:11,033
是 人們常這麼說
Yes, yes, people say this.

304
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,200
帕特裏克 我真心想向你道歉
Patrick, I really wanted to apologize.

305
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,926
我看到你在樓梯上時...
When I found you on the stairs...

306
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:18,893
-不 別提這事  -我答應了把你媽媽找來
- No, no, not this. - I promised I'd get your mother.

307
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,893

Retreat, escape, eject, eject!

308
00:22:20,893 --> 00:22:22,953
我保證 我全都忘了
And I promise you, I've forgotten all about it.

309
00:22:22,953 --> 00:22:25,673
-服務員呢  -你當時很難過
- Where is our waiter? - You seemed in distress.

310
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,253
你總是這樣 你媽媽也是
You always did. Your mother too.

311
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,606
那棟房子有那種氛圍
There was such an atmosphere in that house.

312
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:32,813
我本該幫你的
And I should've done more.

313
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,360
不好意思 我... 真得走了
I'm sorry. I... I really have to go.

314
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,706
什麼 我們才...
What? We've barely...

315
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,733
我5點前要到律師那兒 簽些文件
I have to be at the solicitor's by five. Papers to sign.

316
00:22:49,733 --> 00:22:52,093
-真的嗎 我們才剛剛...  -真煩人對吧
- Really? But we've only just... - Maddening, isn't it?

317
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,086
但你知道 得走程序
But, you know, bureaucracy.

318
00:22:53,086 --> 00:22:56,273
我也沒辦法 所以...
There's only so much I can do, so...

319
00:22:57,373 --> 00:23:00,440
我很感激 你一直待我不薄
Look, I am grateful. You were always very kind to me,

320
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:03,580
從小就是 非常感謝你
ever since I was young and I'm very grateful.

321
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:06,746
可我... 現在... 真得走了
But I... I really... I really must be going now.

322
00:23:06,746 --> 00:23:08,380
走啦 拜
Bye. Bye!

323
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,960
我們已攻下紅海[語出"阿拉伯的勞倫斯" 第35屆奧斯卡最佳影片]
We've taken Aqaba!

324
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,600
先生
Sir?

325
00:23:23,926 --> 00:23:26,166
再來杯超級提神的馬提尼
I'll have another of your very refreshing martinis,

326
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,740
還有韃靼三文魚 韃靼牛肉
and some salmon tartare followed by steak tartare

327
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,380
韃靼 韃靼 要辣 多加辣
tartare-tartare, spicy, very spicy.

328
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,513
再給我一份酒水單
And your wine list.

329
00:23:32,513 --> 00:23:35,300
好孩子 帕特裏克 吃點好東西
Good boy, Patrick. Get something solid inside you.

330
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:38,260
-閉嘴 管家  -有人... 和您共同進餐嗎
- Do be quiet, Nanny. - Will... someone be joining you?

331
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,700
老天啊 我希望沒有
Fucking hell, I hope not!

332
00:23:45,726 --> 00:23:48,480
寧缺毋濫
Only the best or go without!

333
00:23:50,073 --> 00:23:51,433
看到沒 還是管用
You see? That still works.

334
00:23:51,433 --> 00:23:53,220
一切都在掌控之中
Everything is under control.

335
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,033
很好 謝謝你
Very good, thank you.

336
00:23:56,746 --> 00:23:58,613
但這不是海洛因
But it's not heroin.

337
00:24:04,773 --> 00:24:08,113
大部分人 要戒掉海洛因 靠興奮劑抽嗨
Most people, withdrawing from heroin, high on speed,

338
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,386
或被安眠酮和時差搞暈時
cudgeled by Quaaludes and jet-lag

339
00:24:10,393 --> 00:24:13,500
可能會抗拒食物 但我不是
might balk at the idea of food, but not I.

340
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,506
我進食不是因為餓 而是因為激情
I eat not from greed but from passion!

341
00:24:16,506 --> 00:24:17,980
閉嘴 可以嗎
Do shut up, will you?

342
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:21,566
-不是說你... 是其他人  -先生想吃甜點嗎[care for也有照顧之意]
- Not you...someone else. - Would sir care for a dessert?

343
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,893
照顧它 怎麼照顧甜點
Care for it? How do you care for dessert?

344
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:26,080
餵它嗎 週日去看它嗎
Feed it? Visit it on Sundays?

345
00:24:26,926 --> 00:24:29,053
我要一份焦糖奶油和一瓶勃艮第白蘭地
I'll have a creme brûlee and a Marc de Bourgogne.

346
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,593
但這依然不是海洛因 對吧
But it's still not heroin, is it?

347
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,666
海洛因是騎兵 是缺失的椅子腿
Heroin's the cavalry, the missing chair leg.

348
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,293
海洛因是愛 只要打給555-1726...
Heroin is love. Simply call 555-1726...

349
00:24:36,293 --> 00:24:38,080
閉嘴
Shut up!

350
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,570
-您一切都好嗎 先生  -你問了好幾遍
- Everything okay, sir? - You keep asking that.

351
00:24:42,988 --> 00:24:45,820
怎麼可能一切都好  要求太高了
But how can everything be okay? It's simply too much to hope.

352
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,920
因為 很多人在抱怨
Because, there have been some complaints.

353
00:24:47,926 --> 00:24:49,920
我腦子裏的聲音別人也聽得到嗎
You mean the voices aren't just in my head?

354
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,226
該死 或許我該去拿...
Fuck! Perhaps I ought to get the...

355
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,793
請問你能借我25美分
I don't suppose I could trouble you for a quarter

356
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,333
去打電話嗎
for the telephone?

357
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,366
不如這樣吧
Here's the deal.

358
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,873
如果他接了 就吸夠睡覺的海洛因
If he answers, score just enough smack to sleep

359
00:25:02,873 --> 00:25:03,940
再為明早留一點
and a little for the morning.

360
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,033
就這樣 如果他不接 就不吸海洛因了
That's all. And if he doesn't answer, no smack at all.

361
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:08,226
交給命運了
Leave it to fate.

362
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,460
好主意
Good idea.

363
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:17,460
555-1726
555-1726.

364
00:25:22,806 --> 00:25:23,886
我是皮埃爾
This is Pierre.

365
00:25:23,886 --> 00:25:25,480
我現在不能接電話...
I can't come to the phone, right now...

366
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,593
去你的 命運 操 操
Fuck you, fate! Fuck, fuck.

367
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,153
干他媽的命運 操
Fuck, fucking fate, fuck, fuck!

368
00:25:35,253 --> 00:25:36,673
天啊
Oh, God.

369
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,380
好了 先生 我們到了
Okay, man, we're here!

370
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,313
-這不是個好地方  -我全靠這個活
- This is a bad place, y'know. - That's what I'm relying on.

371
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:04,186
在這兒等我
Just wait here for me.

372
00:26:04,186 --> 00:26:06,120
瘋子 我才不等呢
Crazy man. I'm not waiting here!

373
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:12,380
操
Oh, fuck.

374
00:26:22,266 --> 00:26:24,446
你想要什麼 找什麼呢
What you want, man? What are you looking for?

375
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,606

00:26:28,866 --> 00:26:31,566
-你是警察嗎  -當然不是
- You a policeman? - Certainly not.

377
00:26:33,073 --> 00:26:34,206
我是英國人 能帶我去洛蕾塔那兒嗎

You want it, don't cha?

別捅他
Don't stick him!

384
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,453
他... 他是我朋友
He... He's my man.

385
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:07,460
-你好 希利  -我不知道你認識希利

386
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,400

希利說你可能有新注射器
Chilly says you might have a new syringe.

不是全新的 但我煮過了
Well, it ain't exactly new, but I've boiled it and everything.

409
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,953
很鈍嗎
Is it very blunt?

410
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,546
天啊 那不是注射器 是自行車氣筒
Christ, that's not a syringe, it's a bicycle pump.

希利 能建議你換個新燈泡嗎

Hardly worth the effort, I missed the vein.

Right, then, let's do this properly.

426
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,546
寧缺毋濫
Only the best or go without.

427
00:29:32,546 --> 00:29:35,140
哥倫比亞可卡因 然後中國白粉
Columbian cocaine and then China White.

428

434
00:30:04,026 --> 00:30:06,566
-你好嗎  -真是場噩夢

我父親嗎
My father?

437
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:22,073
他最好了 正人君子一個
He was a kitten. A prince among men.

他有藝術家的手 本可以成為首相的

不 不 開個玩笑
No, no, no, it was sort of a joke.

441
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:32,246
在他看來
In his world, it was better

442
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:35,386
要是能當首相更好
if you could have been Prime Minister,

00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:38,994
他從不妥協
He refused to compromise!

589
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:41,194
"寧缺毋濫"
"Nothing but the best, or go without!"

590
00:40:41,194 --> 00:40:41,960
我很贊成
I quite agree!

591
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,154
"不道歉 不解釋" 這句也很經典
"Never apologize, never explain". That was another one.

592
00:40:44,154 --> 00:40:46,200
"仔細觀察 別輕信人"
"Observe everything, Trust no-one."

593
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,274
-都很睿智  -"少折騰 都沒用"
- All very wise. - "Never try, effort's vulgar."

594
00:40:48,274 --> 00:40:50,040
"18世紀才是好時光"
"Things were better in the 18th century."

595
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,565
對了 還有"女人算什麼 特別是你媽"
Oh, and, "Despise all women, but your mother most of all."

596
00:40:59,754 --> 00:41:00,988
摻湯雞尾酒來了
Here are our Bullshots!

597
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,554
牛肉湯加伏特加 需要慢慢品味
Beef consomme and vodka; something of an acquired taste.

598
00:41:04,554 --> 00:41:06,760
品到了 再來一杯
I've acquired it! Another, please.

599
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,777
他父親是位出色的鋼琴家
His father was a very impressive pianist.

600
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,206
-彈的都是別人的  -交際也很強
- If you like pastiche. - And in conversation too.

601
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:12,520
看情況 有些人不喜歡毫無禮貌的交談
That depends. Some people don't like uninterrupted rudeness,

602
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,830
-我是這麼聽說的  -誰說的啊
- or so I'm told. - Who are these people?

603
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,330
沒錯 有一次我勸他說話別那麼沖
It's true, I did once ask him to stop being so argumentative.

604
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:21,376
-他怎麼回答  -叫我滾蛋
- What did he say? - Told me to bugger off!

605
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,464
真是群忠實的老狗
What a lot of faithful gun dogs.

606
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,968
-你說什麼  -看
- Sorry? - There.

607
00:41:30,456 --> 00:41:32,408
你喜歡打獵嗎 帕特裏克
Are you interested in hunting, Patrick?

608
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,680
天吶 開始了
Oh, Christ, here we go.

609
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:35,928
有個故事他可能想聽
I thought he might be interested in a story.

610
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:39,080
你就沒想過 有人不想聽嗎
The thought you never have is that someone might not be interested.

611
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,656
當時我正要開槍殺一隻坦噶尼喀山羊
I'd shot this Tanganyikan mountain goat,

612
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,096
種群裏的最後一隻公羊
the last male of its species,

613
00:41:44,128 --> 00:41:46,536
沒錯 那是個苦樂參半的瞬間
which, of course, was a rather bittersweet moment.

614
00:41:46,568 --> 00:41:47,736
對山羊來說 當然
For the goat, certainly.

615
00:41:47,744 --> 00:41:50,250
我有個打獵的故事 巴蘭坦 關於我爸的
I've got a hunting story for you, Ballantine, from my father.

616
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,904
-尼古拉斯 你知道的  -冷靜點 帕特裏克
- Nicholas, you know the one. - Steady on, Patrick.

617
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:54,370
-夠了  -我爸當過騎兵軍官
- Enough now. - Father was a cavalry officer

618
00:41:54,376 --> 00:41:56,410
在20年代駐紮印度
stationed in India in the 1920s,

619
00:41:56,424 --> 00:41:59,120
他喜歡獵豬 帶著長矛穿過草叢
and he used to go pig-sticking, galloping through the high grass

620
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,568
尋找野豬
with a lance, hunting wild boar.

621
00:42:01,584 --> 00:42:03,928
那些野豬很兇猛 能撞倒馬匹
Very dangerous, these wild boar. They could take down a horse,

622
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:06,080
把人頂死 但也很刺激
and gore a rider to death, but thrilling too.

623
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,750
總之 那次狩獵唯一的遺憾...
Anyway, the only blemish on this particular trip...

624
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,336
我聽這故事時好像才8歲吧
I think I heard this story when I was, what, eight?

625
00:42:11,352 --> 00:42:14,128
...是有個獵人被一隻野狗咬了
...was that one of the hunting party was bitten by a wild dog

626
00:42:14,128 --> 00:42:15,696
狂犬病發作
and developed the symptoms of rabies.

627
00:42:15,712 --> 00:42:18,032
最近的醫院要三天的路程
Three days from the nearest hospital and this hunting party

628
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,240
所以這群將軍和大人決定
of judges and generals decided to truss up

629
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:22,870
把這位口吐白沫的朋友綁起來
their foaming, thrashing friend in a net

630
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,896
用一張網吊在半空中
and hoist him off the ground.

631
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,072
晚飯開始了...
Dinner was served...

632
00:42:27,368 --> 00:42:30,648
桌上放著燈 銀光閃閃
Lanterns down the table, gleam of silver,

633
00:42:30,688 --> 00:42:32,392
僕人們訓練有素
well-trained servants.

634
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,830
可在尖叫聲中 我們誰都吃不下飯
But none of us could quite enjoy dinner with all that screaming.

635
00:42:37,224 --> 00:42:38,952
於是我離開餐桌
So I got up from the table,

636
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,568
拿上手槍 走向那個發瘋的人
fetched my pistol, went over to the rabid man

637
00:42:42,616 --> 00:42:44,488
給了他腦袋一槍
and shot him in the head.

638
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,768
這是最仁慈的做法
Much the kindest thing to do.

639
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,008
到最後
Everyone agreed.

640
00:42:55,048 --> 00:42:56,330
人人都接受
Eventually.

641
00:42:57,704 --> 00:42:59,312
我想就是那時
And that, I think,

642
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:02,320
我與藥物結下了不解之緣
was the beginning of my love affair with medicine.

643
00:43:22,664 --> 00:43:23,752
抱歉
Excuse me.

644
00:43:30,312 --> 00:43:32,424
你應該進隔間
You might have used the stall!

645
00:43:34,016 --> 00:43:35,160
好主意
Good idea.

646
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,870
天啊 爸爸
Oh, Christ. Dad.

647
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,450
我得去拿骨灰 媽的
I've got to pick up Dad. Fuck.

648
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,160
借過
Excuse me.

649
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,700
你好 嘿
Hello. Hello?

650
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:10,632
拜託 我爸還在裏面
Please. You have my father!

651
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:12,384
-我們已經打烊了  -不行
- I'm afraid we're closed. - No.

652
00:44:12,456 --> 00:44:14,528
-我現在就要他的骨灰  -不好意思
- I need his remains now. - I'm sorry.

653
00:44:14,552 --> 00:44:19,136
我明天一早就走 我不能拋下他
I'm flying first thing. And I can't leave without him!

654
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:22,976
是... 大衛·梅爾羅斯
It's... David Melrose.

655
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,528
求你了
Please?

656
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:36,250
可以要個紙袋嗎
Could I possibly trouble you for a paper bag?

657
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,950
現在  瑪麗安
Now, Marianne.

658
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,128
我有500克可卡因  0.2克海洛因
I have half a gram of coke, a fifth of heroin,

659
00:44:41,152 --> 00:44:42,888
一份安眠酮  一份黑美人
one Quaalude, one Black Beauty.

660
00:44:42,912 --> 00:44:44,672
幾句暖場對白
A few lines to get the conversation flowing,

661
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:46,330
一份讓瑪麗安心情愉悅的安眠酮
a Quaalude for Marianne to get her in the mood.

662
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,624
也許傷心也是種理由
Perhaps pity is the way,

663
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,576
讓人在失落的時候 還能在飛機上小憩
in which case use it for the comedown, sleep on the plane.

664
00:44:49,592 --> 00:44:50,648
上帝保佑 你沒事的
My God, you're good.

665
00:44:50,664 --> 00:44:52,910
然後你回到家 感謝協和號飛機
Then you're home, thank Christ for Concorde.

666
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:55,080
強尼會等著你...
Johnny will be waiting and...

667
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,560
見機行事吧
Well, let's see.

668
00:44:59,072 --> 00:45:02,248
你好 我是帕特裏克 瑪麗安的朋友
Hello, I'm Patrick, Marianne's friend.

669
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:05,152
南希 南希·班克斯 我們見過
Nancy, Nancy Banks. We have met.

670
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:06,952
是的
Yes, of course. Oh!

671
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:10,688
抱歉 我剛有點走神了 這是...
Sorry, bit distracted. It's just...

672
00:45:10,696 --> 00:45:13,240
沒事 瑪麗安說了 是你父親嗎
Yes, Marianne told us. Is that him?

673
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:15,872
我讓康蘇拉加一個人的飯
I'll tell Consuela there'll be one more for dinner!

674
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,290
瑪麗安
Marianne!

675
00:45:18,312 --> 00:45:20,080
她可想見你了
She is dying to see you!

676
00:45:20,112 --> 00:45:23,712
傑瑞 你還記得帕特裏克吧 黛比小可愛的男朋友
Jerry, you remember Patrick, lovely Debbie's boyfriend.

677
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:25,432
我在你們的洗手間暈倒了
I turned blue in your bathroom.

678
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:27,744
-我們只好把門卸了  -是我
- We had to take the door off! - Yes!

679
00:45:27,752 --> 00:45:29,624
-進來  -正是本人
- Come in, come in! - 'Tis I.

680
00:45:32,072 --> 00:45:34,888
瑪麗安說他很了不起
Marianne says he was a remarkable man.

681
00:45:34,904 --> 00:45:37,000
你們應該聽聽我的事跡
Hm! You should have heard the remarks.

682
00:45:37,032 --> 00:45:39,450
你們的關係不太好是嗎 帕特裏克
Was it a difficult relationship, Patrick?

683
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,808
是的 南希 挺不容易的
Yes, Nancy. Yes, it was.

684
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:45,040
-悲劇什麼時候開始的  -1906年7月9日
- When did the trouble start? - 9th June, 1906.

685
00:45:45,064 --> 00:45:46,312
他出生那天
The day he was born.

686
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,544
那個年代當爸爸跟現在不同
Well, fatherhood was very different in those days.

687
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,792
是的 也許他只是不知道怎麼表達愛
Yes, perhaps he just didn't know how to express his love?

688
00:45:53,848 --> 00:45:55,776
殘忍是愛的對立面
Cruelty is the opposite of love,

689
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,392
不是愛的另一種表達
not some inarticulate expression of it.

690
00:45:58,448 --> 00:46:00,500
我同意
That sounds about right to me.

691
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,472
噢 瑪麗安...
Oh, Marianne...

692
00:46:04,832 --> 00:46:08,152
但我從不用擔心這個
Although, that's not something I've ever had to worry about.

693
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:10,392
-你好 帕特裏克  -你好
- Hi, Patrick. - Hello.

694
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,768
對於你父親的離開 我很遺憾
I'm so, so sorry for your loss.

695
00:46:12,776 --> 00:46:15,112
你就是答案 我的救星 你知道嗎
You're the answer. You're the one to save me, can't you tell?

696
00:46:15,112 --> 00:46:16,192
我想死在這裏
I want to be buried here.

697
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,840
如果能擁有你 我願意一輩子不沾毒品
If I could have you, I'd give up drugs forever.

698
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:18,936
我的天
Goodness!

699
00:46:19,064 --> 00:46:21,660
或者至少找個有魅力的人一起吸毒
Or at least have someone attractive to take them with.

700
00:46:21,688 --> 00:46:24,424
我們共進晚餐好嗎 答應我吧
Can we go out to dinner? Please say yes!

701
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,808
-你喜歡這裏嗎  -當然 我喜歡亞美尼亞菜
- Does this look alright to you? - Absolutely. I love Armenian.

702
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,568
你穿著外套不熱嗎
Are you gonna be hot in your coat?

703
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:36,344
你看著不舒服的話...
Oh. If it makes you feel uncomfortable, then...

704
00:46:36,368 --> 00:46:38,540
-有點  -好的 馬上脫
- A little. - Well, off it comes.

705
00:46:39,552 --> 00:46:41,800
也許我應該把眼罩也摘下來...
Perhaps I should take my eye-patch off too...

706
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,064
還是戴著吧 請上兩杯馬提尼
I'll leave it on. Two martinis, please.

707
00:46:44,368 --> 00:46:47,832
-一杯就行  我不喝酒  -不喝嗎
- One. I don't drink. - Don't you?

708
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:49,500
情況不妙 非常非常不妙
Bad sign. Very, very bad.

709
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,040
喝酒會讓視線模糊  反應遲鈍
I find it blurs the edges and dulls the senses.

710
00:46:52,064 --> 00:46:53,272
你的意思是
Your point being?

711
00:46:53,408 --> 00:46:54,680
我完全同意
I absolutely agree.

712
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:57,816
我也不常喝 只有傷心的時候才...
I don't usually either but, you know... grief.

713
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:02,032
找點話題 別忘了步驟
Say something, remember how this is done,

714
00:47:02,048 --> 00:47:04,192
除了撒謊 取笑和蔑視都行
Something other than lies or ridicule or contempt.

715
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:05,536
黛比向你問好
Debbie sends her love.

716
00:47:05,536 --> 00:47:08,120
-說這個幹嘛 傻逼  -黛比太好了
- Not that, you fucking idiot! -  Sweet Debbie.

717
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:12,712
-她還好嗎  -她是個很好的女孩
- How is she? - Oh, she's a great girl.

718
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:15,750
非常非常有同情心
Very, very supportive.

719
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,632
換個話題
Change the subject.

720
00:47:17,808 --> 00:47:19,750
她說你在學習法律
She tells me you're studying law.

721
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,080
是的 在哥倫比亞大學
That's right! At Columbia.

722
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,664
很難 但我喜歡
It's really tough, but I love it.

723
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,248
我也想過學法律
I once thought about studying law.

724
00:47:26,264 --> 00:47:28,944
想像自己像"十二怒漢"那樣 唇槍舌劍
Imagined myself in Twelve Angry Men, terrifically articulate,

725
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,912
懲惡揚善...
righting wrongs...

726
00:47:29,928 --> 00:47:31,416
你會成為一名出色的律師
You'd have been a wonderful lawyer.

727
00:47:31,424 --> 00:47:33,552
-謝謝誇獎  -你應該試試
- Thank you. - You absolutely should do it!

728
00:47:33,568 --> 00:47:34,880
-為什麼不呢  -因為努力
- Why don't you? - 'Cause hard work

729
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:36,592
-和野心都沒有用  -天啊
- and ambition are vulgar. - Oh, my God,

730
00:47:36,608 --> 00:47:37,856
你不相信這句話吧
you don't believe that, do you?

731
00:47:37,864 --> 00:47:40,330
我嗎 不 沒有 是我父親說的
Me? No, no, no, no, That's what he said.

732
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:44,552
你受過良好教育 而且...
Well, you have an education and...

733
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,450
謝謝 我意思是...
Thank you. I mean...

734
00:47:50,448 --> 00:47:54,410
而且 你跟你父親不一樣
And besides, you're not your father.

735
00:47:54,424 --> 00:47:56,910
你說的太對了
You are absolutely right.

736
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,728
你知道嗎 我備受鼓舞
Do you know what? I feel inspired!

737
00:47:59,152 --> 00:48:01,408
下飛機我就準備這事
I'm gonna do something about it the minute I get off the plane.

A new man! Do you hear that, Dad? I'm gonna be a lawyer!

帕特裏克 我有點擔心那個盒子
Patrick, I'm concerned about the box.

740
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,624
不用管它 就當做隨身行李就好
Don't be, I think it counts as hand luggage.

741
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,776
不不不... 你能把它放地上嗎
No, no, no, I mean... Could you put it on the floor?

742
00:48:10,136 --> 00:48:11,320
好
Yes!

743
00:48:11,984 --> 00:48:16,408
隨服務員們踢去吧 終於報仇了
Let the waiters kick him about. Revenge at last!

744
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,776
為什麼他死了就能逃避一切
Why should he get away with it, just because he's dead?

745
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,910
逃避什麼
Get away with what?

746
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:29,540
不好意思 我離開一下
I'm sorry. Will you forgive me?

747
00:48:38,184 --> 00:48:40,208
我以為你喜歡亞美尼亞菜

馬提尼酒挺好喝的
The martinis are excellent.

749

750
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,064
也許不是有意 但事實如此" [語出詩人拉金 "這就是詩"]
They may not mean to, but they do."

751
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,696
誰說他們不是故意的
Who says they don't mean to?

752
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:54,580
你跟你爸說過自己的感受嗎
Tell me, did you ever tell your dad how you felt about him?

753
00:48:54,608 --> 00:48:57,280
他活著的時候 沒有
Not while he was alive.

754
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:59,660
-也許這樣最好  -為什麼
- Probably for the best. - Why?

755
00:48:59,664 --> 00:49:01,808
我想知道 你會說什麼
I mean, what would you have said to him?

756
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,200
我... 我會告訴他...
I... I would have said...

757
00:49:09,632 --> 00:49:11,472
我會跟他說...
I would have told him...

758
00:49:11,584 --> 00:49:13,896
"沒人能那樣對待任何人"

759

I took the question seriously.

761
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,616
對不起 你剛說什麼
Oh, no, I'm sorry, you were saying?

762
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,248
我說...
Just that...

763
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:28,632
算了
Never mind.

764
00:49:33,312 --> 00:49:35,832

你我之間是有感覺的 對嗎
We've always had a connection, haven't we?

767
00:49:43,384 --> 00:49:46,104
不是我一廂情願
I mean, I'm not just imagining it.

768
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:50,408
不 我一直很喜歡你和黛比
Well, no, I've always been very fond of you and Debbie.

769
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:56,048
你想來點安眠酮嗎
I don't suppose you want to do a Quaalude, do you?

770
00:49:56,392 --> 00:49:59,104
抱歉我狀態不好
I'm sorry for being a bit screwy.

771
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:01,056

你知道嗎 有時候我覺得自己要是遇到了對的人
You know, sometimes I think if I was to meet the right woman,

776

聰明 敢於挑戰我的女孩
someone intelligent, who wasn't afraid to challenge me,

777
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,096
我也許真能回歸正常的生活
I might actually be able to get my life back in order.

778
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,080

不 求你了 別走

我是個笨蛋 對不起 可求你了 別走
I'm an idiot, I'm sorry, but, look, please don't go!

Look. I don't wanna be on my own tonight, I can't.

沒別的人 就陪我坐坐吧

我要把你衝下馬桶
I'm gonna flush you down the loo,

怎麼可能
How?

800
00:52:24,552 --> 00:52:26,752
這破窗戶有什麼用
What's the point of a fucking window

801
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,392
跳樓都不行

你又不是沒辦法
Well, it's not as if you don't have the means.

No, Patrick.

00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,856
先開刀 再打麻藥
Scalpel first, anesthetic afterwards.

808
00:52:54,912 --> 00:52:58,856
噓 你安全了 沒人能發現你在這兒
Ssssh! You're safe. Nobody can find you here.

809
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,870
可沒有人發現我怎麼辦呢

老天爺 好一個破爛垃圾堆

生活不只是袋屎 還是袋漏了的屎
